### Abstract

Social movements, as well as human rights movements, usually start or are resurrected after heavily mediatised traumatic events e.g: Black Lives Matter was founded in 2013 and was revived in 2020 after Floydâ€™s death. 
However, non-traumatic events can also act as catalysts for such movements e.g: Bombshell movie in 2019 opened a conversation about workplace sexual harassment and revived the #metoo movement which was originally founded in 2006. 

The goal of our project is to build a timeline of the #metoo movement to analyze the influence of different events (traumatic as well as non-traumatic events) on this movement throughout the years. 
This could be done by monitoring the number of quotes that include the word #metoo or other related words over time.
Next, we create two other timelines, one which contains traumatic events and another one for non-traumatic events. 
Finally, we can use these timelines to correlate the occurrence of (non-)traumatic events with sudden increases in quotes related to #metoo, a sudden increase in quotes could be related to a specific event. 


### Research questions

Our first goal is the identification of events that have a significant event on the amount of quotes related to a subject. 
Once this is done, given we find enough data we could train a model to predict the impact of certain non-traumatic events. 
Another question is how the timing of such events matters, e.g. what if we changed the timing of the event to be a few weeks later ?
